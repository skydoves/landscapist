Add the codes below to your **root** `build.gradle` file (not your module-level build.gradle file):

```Groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Next, add the dependency below to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file:

=== "Groovy"

    ```Groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation "com.github.skydoves:landscapist-glide:2.6.0"
    }
    ```

=== "KTS"

    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.skydoves:landscapist-glide:2.6.0")
    }
    ```

!!! note

    `Landscapist-Glide` includes version `4.15.1` of [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) internally. So please make sure your project uses the same Glide version or exclude the Glide dependency to adapt yours. Also, please make sure the Jetpack Compose version on the [release page](https://github.com/skydoves/Landscapist/releases).

### GlideImage

You can load images simply by using `GlideImage` composable function as the following example below:

```kotlin
GlideImage(
  imageModel = { imageUrl }, // loading a network image using an URL.
  imageOptions = ImageOptions(
    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop,
    alignment = Alignment.Center
  )
)
```

### Compose Metrics

According to the [Compose Compiler Metrics](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/compiler/design/compiler-metrics.md), the `GlideImage` Composable function is marked as Restartable and Skippable. This means you don't have to worry about performance issues related to re-rendering or re-fetching problems that can occur during recomposition. The Composable function's restartable and skippable nature ensures that the necessary actions are taken to optimize rendering, making it more efficient and seamless.
